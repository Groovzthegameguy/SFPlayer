## Getting Started
To start, clone this repo by running
```
git clone https://github.com/Synthium0/SFPlayer.git
```
Then, ensure you have all the modules required for this project by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Next, go to the [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) website and download the latest Windows Executeable, and place it in the SFPlayer-main folder
Then, run the program!
```
python main.py
```
## Getting Games
In order to use this launcher, you will need some games, a good source to find these games is an [index](https://fpconnect.fisher-price.com/dssupdate/) on Fisher Price's website. This index has a lot more than iXL Learning System games, but usually games will have a "Mac_Software" folder and "PC_Software" folder.

From here, Download the .zip in the PC_Software folder, and extract it to a folder. Then create a "Games" and place the newly downloaded game folder inside the "Games" folder.
