```
cd SFPlayer

## Getting Games
In order to use this launcher, you will need some games, a good source to find these games is an [index](https://fpconnect.fisher-price.com/dssupdate/) on Fisher Price's website. This index has a lot more than iXL Learning System games, but usually games will have a "Mac_Software" folder and "PC_Software" folder.

From here, Download the .zip in the PC_Software folder, create a folder called "Games" in the SFPlayer folder, and then add your .zip file to it.
