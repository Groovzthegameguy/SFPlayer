Next, download any Flash Player standalone binary for your operating system, It is strongly recommended that you use Flash Player 9 from [here](https://ia801806.us.archive.org/13/items/standaloneflashplayers/fp/fp_9/9.0.47.0/flashplayer9r47_win_standalone_debug.exe). Once you have your Flash Player binary, place it in the "Flash" folder.

## Getting Games
In order to use this launcher, you will need some games, a good source to find these games is an [index](https://fpconnect.fisher-price.com/dssupdate/) on Fisher Price's website. This index has a lot more than iXL Learning System games, but usually games will have a "Mac_Software" folder and "PC_Software" folder.

From here, Download the .zip in the PC_Software folder, and extract it to a folder. Then, Place the .zip inside the "Games" folder.
